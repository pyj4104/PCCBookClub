== Preface

=== Summary

. Sabbath and rest are not only about "`not doing anything`" or "`Thou Shalt Nots`"
. Two aspects of Jewish understanding of Sabbath
.. Resistance
... Visible insistence that our lives are not defined by the production and consumption of commodity goods
.. Alternative way of living
... Awareness and practice of the claim that we are situated on the receiving end of the gifts of God
... Discipleship--loving instead of '`making it`' in the economic world of command performance

=== Questions

. How does the author define the characteristics of the society?
.. A. Restless, commodity-propelled, anxious, "heavy yoke", endless, doing more, imperialism, producing, market ideology, 24/7 multi-tasking, consuming
. Author seems to analyze the '`alternative`' way of living as political and communal practice. Do you agree? Why or why not?
